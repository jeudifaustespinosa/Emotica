[UploadinThis is the first game I made during my first year in college as a BSIT student (2025). I want to be honest: I didn’t code the whole game myself. I used AI to help write parts of it.

That said, I know how my game works and how the logic of the code flows. I used AI to speed things up because I didn’t have much time, and honestly, I was too lazy to fully understand every detail. I know the best way to learn is to code everything yourself, but this kind of project is really hard when it’s not something you’ve fully thought through.

I don’t really recommend relying on AI unless you truly understand your code and can explain it like I can. AI can’t fix problems in your code most of the time. For example, I struggled with a problem that wasn’t in my main file but in another module. I had to check each module one by one to find the issue, and I was the only one who could fix it because AI doesn’t have access to all my files.

Testing all the choices and possible endings is very draining. I often felt like I was losing my patience, and sometimes I spaced out trying to figure out what went wrong or how to fix it. I also ran into problems like figuring out how to give each boss or NPC a different storyline so it wouldn’t repeat over and over. I asked AI for help, but I still had to read everything carefully, understand the logic, and figure out how it worked. I don’t fully understand everything yet, but I know how it functions.

That’s all. Thank you.g dont read me.txt…]()
