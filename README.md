Testing all the choices and possible endings is very draining. I often felt like I was losing my patience, and sometimes I spaced out trying to figure out what went wrong or how to fix it. I also ran into problems like figuring out how to give each boss or NPC a different storyline so it wouldn’t repeat over and over. I asked AI for help, but I still had to read everything carefully, understand the logic, and figure out how it worked. I don’t fully understand everything yet, but I know how it functions.

That’s all. Thank you.g dont read me.txt…]()
